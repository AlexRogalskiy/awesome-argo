A curated list of awesome projects and resources related to [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/), a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) hosted project.

## What is Argo?

Argo consists of a set of open source tools for Kubernetes to run workflows, manage clusters, and do GitOps right, including:
* [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/workflows/): Kubernetes-native workflow engine supporting DAG and step-based workflows.
* [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/): Declarative continuous delivery with a fully-loaded UI.
* [Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts/): Advanced Kubernetes deployment strategies such as Canary and Blue-Green made easy.
* [Argo Events](https://argoproj.github.io/events/): Event based dependency management for Kubernetes.
