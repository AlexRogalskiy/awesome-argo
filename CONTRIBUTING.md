## Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for considering contributing to this awesome list!

Please pay attention to the following when preparing a pull request:

* All items must be added to the list in alphabetical order.
* All projects must be open sourced with a link to the repository and a short description.
* Not all proposed changes will be accepted given that this is a curated list. Please avoid sending changes that are sales pitches and vendor-specific. Hopefully this could serve as an encouragement to content and project creators to bring more value and innovation to the Argo ecosystem.
* While feedback will be solicited from other Argo maintainers and contributors, it's up to the maintainer of this repo to decide whether a proposed change should be included. Please [contact the maintainer](https://github.com/terrytangyuan) if you have any questions.
